## Benjamin Craven

I am a former solicitor who used to work in the City in private practice in a global law firm and more recently, in-house at a top accountancy firm. Before qualifying as a solicitor, I wrote online case summaries for Thomson Reuters.

I was inspired to change career by the book, Quit Law and Learn to Code by William Ha. It made me realise that my legal skills, such as attention to detail, focus, fast learning, succinct drafting and problem solving were directly transferrable and beneficial to coding. With no experience in coding I started with a few courses on Codeacademy before attending a weekend course in HTML and CSS.

Each step fed my curiosity and excitement and in February 2017 I took the decision to quit as a solicitor and enrol with [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a full-time 16 week software development bootcamp.

I am really enjoying the course. The problem solving is compelling and time literally flies when I am absorbed in coding. I like working on the back-end and take great pleasure in creating things that can be used by people. I am looking for a back-end or full-stack role in an environment, where I can continue to develop and improve the skills I have learnt at Makers Academy while adding value to the organisation.

**Technical Skills:** Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, HTML, HTML5 Canvas, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Jasmine, PostgreSQL

**Behavioural Skills:** XP values, TDD, Agile, debugging, pair programming, whole-team projects, code reviews

## Skills

#### Teamwork

I am naturally personable and flexible in my dealings with other people. I work well both in teams and individually. Every day at Makers Academy we pair program with someone different and I am able to adapt my working style to ensure each day is productive for both my pair partner and I. As a lawyer I worked successfully with lawyers and non-lawyers and with people from a whole range of business seniority.

#### Attention to detail

I have a keen eye for detail which has been developed from working as a lawyer. It is something which helps to ensure that I closely monitor code to ensure it is free from typos and missing content. I appreciate the importance of formatting conventions.

#### Fast learner

Working as a defence lawyer and then as a generalist in-house I have not only had to quickly understand a wide variety of legal issues but also to understand business specific issues that might be relevant to that particular case, often in an extremely high pressure environment. In week 9 of the course, working in a group of 5, I learnt the basics of HTML5 Canvas and used it to build a PacMan clone in less than three days.


#### Research skills/analytical approach

In private practice and in house I was regarded for my careful and thorough approach to legal research. I was often tasked with finding an urgent answer to challenging legal problems and this was something I particularly enjoyed. In my last weeks as a lawyer I was assigned a project to look into the firm’s reporting requirements. The work will be instrumental in forming the basis of the firm’s requirement to publish a statement later this year.

#### Communication

As a cases editor for online legal website, Lawtel I learnt to draft case summaries succinctly and clearly to tight deadlines. While in private practice I drafted articles for external publications and client newsletters. I was also a member of the newly formed IT/IP team and I drafted an article on copyright protection for software developers ([see here](http://www.mondaq.co.uk/uk/x/181208/Copyright/SAS+No+Copyright+SOS+For+Software+Developers "Mondaq Article")).

I think there is great value in being able to explain complex coding principles in simple, clear English and this is something which I strive to do both for my understanding and to help others.
