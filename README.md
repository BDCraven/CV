## Benjamin Craven

I am a solicitor who trained and qualified at a global law firm before moving to the in-house legal team of a top 10 global accountancy firm with a wide variety of experience covering all aspects of the professional services sector. Before qualifying as a solicitor I wrote online case summaries for Thomson Reuters.
I was inspired to change career by a book, called Quit Law and Learn to Code by William Ha. It made me realise that many of my legal skills, such as attention to detail, focus, the ability to understand complex issues quickly, succinct drafting and problem solving were directly transferrable and beneficial to coding. With no experience in coding I started with a few courses on Codeacademy before attending a weekend course learning the basics of how to build a website in HTML and CSS. Each step fed my curiosity and excitement and I eventually took the plunge to quit my job and enrol with Makers Academy, a full-time 16 week software development bootcamp.
I am keen to find employment as soon as possible after the graduation in September. I am confident that my overall experience would be particularly valuable to roles in professional firms or companies servicing the professional sector as I understand their business requirements. Ultimately, the ideal position is one where I can quickly learn and develop my skills as a developer while adding value to the organisation.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

I am naturally personable and flexible in my dealings with other people. I work well both in teams and individually. Every day at Makers Academy we pair program with someone different and I am exposed to people with a wide variety of backgrounds and abilities. I am confident that I am able to adapt my working style to ensure each day is productive for both my pair and I. As a lawyer I worked successfully with lawyers and non-lawyers and with people from a whole range of business seniority.

#### Attention to detail

I have a keen eye for detail which has been developed from working as a lawyer. It is something which helps to ensure that I closely monitor code to ensure it is free from typos and missing content. I appreciate the importance of formatting conventions and I hope that as I develop as a coder I will learn to write code that is clean, simple, clear and readable.

#### Fast learner

Working as a defence lawyer and then as a generalist in-house I have not only had to quickly understand a wide variety of legal issues but also to understand business specific issues that might be relevant to that particular case, often in an extremely high pressure environment. I am confident this will be reflected in my ability to quickly pick up and master the complex coding concepts we will be introduced to as the bootcamp develops.

#### Research skills/analytical approach

In private practice and in house I was regarded for my careful and thorough approach to legal research. I was often tasked with finding an urgent answer to challenging legal problems and this was something I particularly enjoyed. In my last weeks as a lawyer I was assigned a project to look into the firm’s reporting requirements. The work will be instrumental in forming the basis of the firm’s requirement to publish a statement later this year.

In the early stages of bootcamp I have already seen the benefit of being able to effectively carry out online research for coding problems to find an answer quickly.

#### Communication

As a cases editor for online legal website, Lawtel I learnt to draft case summaries succinctly and clearly to tight deadlines. While in private practice I drafted articles for external publications and client newsletters. I was also a member of the newly formed IT/IP team and I drafted an article on copyright protection for software developers ([see here](http://www.mondaq.co.uk/uk/x/181208/Copyright/SAS+No+Copyright+SOS+For+Software+Developers "Mondaq Article")).

I think there is great value in being able to explain complex coding principles in simple, clear English and this is something which I strive to do both for my understanding and to help others.
